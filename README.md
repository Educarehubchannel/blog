Health & Fitness Secret Tips For Losing Fat – Enhance Your After-Burn

Secret Weapons For Losing Fat – Enhance Your After-Burn
Monday, October 31st, 2011
A key way the human body burns calories is with Exercise Post-Oxygen Consumption (EPOC), or what most people refer to as the afterburn effect. When we employ afterburn training, we throw the body into a form of madness. After the workouts are over, our bodies expend calories to get the body back into its pre-exercise condition. Accomplishing this state, in my view, is the most critical element in the case of getting lean. 

How can we arrive at this chaotic state? 

The training that will throw the body into a chaotic state would include, supersets, circuits, and high intensity interval training. Which can be carried out with either free weights, kettlebells, straps, swiss-balls, ab-wheels, your own bodyweight, cardio machines, and also the outside world. It’s essentially when using any of the previous ways to train haveing a raised pulse rate, with inadequate recovery, is when your are performing some type of afterburn training. 

Being familiar with EPOC and Oxygen Debt

When you perform a challenging circuit or a sprint, the body can not produce the necessary oxygen at a rate rapidly enough to energize the muscle. An alternative energy system (anaerobic) has to start working to “assist” with supplying energy to the muscle. As soon as the intense work is accomplished, your body has got to in essence pay back that “borrowed energy”…it owes oxygen to get those muscles back to their normal state….the primary reason we are breathing so hard. The more energy the body borrowed throughout an intense effort the more oxygen it owes…this is known as Oxygen Debt. 

Fasted training for fat reduction 

If you eat before you train you’re going to burn off food energy not fat energy throughout your workout. To put it succinctly, eating ahead of a workout gets in the way of burning body fat during the workout. Plus…eating secretes the hormone insulin, which impedes your body’s capability to burn body fat.  The key is not to eat anything 4-5 hours in advance of your workout like <a href="https://www.educarehubchannel.xyz/2021/02/know-about-yoga-poses-or-asanas.html">Yoga Poses or Asanas</a>. 

Your power will sky-rocket 

When fasting the body’s flight or fight response is induced (the Sympathetic Nervous System) increasing the body’s energy system. When it’s in gear, the body is in its most energy-producing phase, and that’s when the most energy emanates from fat burning.” 

Eating before a workout decreases energy 

When you eat, what’s going to occur is you will turn off the body’s energy system and trigger the Para Sympathetic Nervous System. The PSNS will make you tired, slow and less resistant against exhaustion and stress. As opposed to spending energy and burning fat, the body may well be more geared toward storing energy and gaining fat.” 

A low intensity workout isn’t going to take advantage of the afterburn effect 

What I see a lot of the time is people not taking their workout serious enough. Walks on the treadmill just isn’t going to cut it if fat reduction is your motive. You must push the body to where you’re breathing really hard and sweating like crazy if you want the afterburn effect. 

Too High of intensity isn’t good also 

For me the main issue with too much of an intensity is what Brad Pilon calls the Activity Sine Wave. When your workout is to arduous and intense, you are very likely to “overcompensate” by resting a lot more than normal after your workout. You shouldn’t need extra rest from a workout. Training then sitting on the couch all day long is not a effective fat loss method. 

The “HGH Flush” is what your interested in 

The “hgh flush” occurs when your skin gets red and hot to the touch. Try to remember running lines in PE class in high school when your teacher would push you and your skin felt like it was on fire. This is the HGH flush which is certainly a signal that your fat burning capacity will be enhanced immediately following your workout and that your body will release a bit more HGH than usual (your body’s fat burning hormone). 

Choose a workout that creates the afterburn effect…..intervals, circuits, supersets. Train in a fasted state to make sure you are getting the absolute best fat burning workout. And also remember to find the proper intensity or “sweet spot”. Put all this together and you will burn through that fat quickly.
