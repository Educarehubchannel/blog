<h2> How to Maintain Health & Fitness Tips For a Healthy Holiday Season </h2>
The holiday season is right around the corner and now is the time to prepare for a healthy holiday. Preparation is the key to avoid all the unhealthy pitfalls during the holidays. Every year I hear and see the same pattern from many of our patients, I like to call it the, “great disconnect”. This happens when you disconnect from all the healthy things that you have been doing so well all year long.  The diet goes out the window, the exercise plan is nonexistent, and the word health is not in your vocabulary. This behavior might last for a few months.  I hope and pray that I can keep you from these nasty pitfalls. Here are a few tips to help you through the holidays.

1. Set your health and fitness goals for next year now. It’s ok to have more than one goal and be realistic. Start by thinking about your body weight, body fat, waist size, blood pressure, eating habits, etc.
2. Do something each day that will bring you closer to the fitness or the health goal that you have set for yourself.  Whether its cutting the sugar out, doing 30 minutes of cardio, drinking more water, or improving on one of your fitness tests.
3. Prepare your workouts for the week.  Even if you are traveling make time to exercise.  There are plenty of workouts that you can do without a gym.
4. Keep a logbook of your workouts, times, distances, your weight, body fat %, learn about <a href="https://www.educarehubchannel.xyz/2021/02/know-about-yoga-poses-or-asanas.html">Yoga Poses or Asanas</a> and make this daily practice.
5. Challenge yourself on a daily basis, whether it’s a better time in a workout or covering a longer distance running. This keeps things fresh and exciting.
6. Watch your diet, and stay away from foods that cause your blood sugar to become elevated.  Things such as cakes, cookies, pies, doughnuts, etc.
7. Drink plenty of water; water keeps your body hydrated and your metabolism in high gear. A good gauge is your body weight divided in half will give you the number of ounces to drink daily.  If you weigh 150 pounds, 75 ounces would be a realistic goal.
8. Putting the fork down is this best way to avoid the over indulgence of certain foods. It’s hard to avoid some foods during the holidays, especially the bad ones.  Use moderation when you do go off your diet plan.
9. Share your plan with your spouse, family member, friend, or co-worker.  Being accountable to someone will help you achieve your goals faster.
10. Find a workout partner, it’s always easier to stay on track when you have someone that can push you or vise versa. This is strongly recommended during the holidays.
11. Regular Chiropractic adjustments remove nerve stress and allow the body to function optimally.  Chiropractic adjustments will help boost your immune system and prevent your system from being compromised during the holidays.
